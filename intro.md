You Are NOT Alone. #Metoo
=======================
## Approximately 30% of sexual assault cases are reported to authorities, according to [Department of Justice](https://www.nsopw.gov/en/Education/FactsStatistics?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#reference). Among sexual abuse with adults victims, only 16% of all rapes were reported to law enforcement. Among college women, about 12% of rapes were reported to law enforcement.

## What classifies as a sexual assault?
According to the United States [Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault), sexual assault is 'any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.' The legal definitaion varies depending on which state you're in, and where you were when the assault happened.

## Goal of our website
There are many reasons and factors that discourage women to report sexual assault to law enforcement or to public. We hope to break the border and raise the awareness of sexual assault by building a private database of sexual assaults, so that victims know that they are not alone. 

We also hope to provide useful resources for victims.
