Future Direction
=======================
This website is built using R and Shiny application. The application is created by Phoebe Wong, Primary Research Analyst at Legendary Applied Analytics. The data and data analysis in Python is done by Caroline Butler, Data Specialist at Legendary Applied Analytics.

We don't have a solid direction of further direction yet, however, we have a few things that we wanted to improve on:

1. Historical Twitter Data
* Due to Twitter API limit, we are unable to query more data than what we have. The Twitter API provides tweets that were posted up to one week ago.

2. Live update of the [survey data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S9KShDLvU7C-KkgEevYTHXr3F6InTenrBsS9yk-8C5M/edit#gid=1530077352)shared by Dr. Kelsky

3. Integration of other sexual assault databases
* We will be interested to build a more comprehesive database of reported sexual assault.

4. Twitter Bots
* We are interestd in building a twitter bot that will reply to tweets with #MeToo hashtags with helpful resources.
